 		<h4 id="descrip">Description</h4>
 		<p>This program generates cryptographic data files used by the NTPv4 authentication and identification schemes. It generates MD5 key files used in symmetric key cryptography. In addition, if the OpenSSL software library has been installed, it generates keys, certificate and identity files used in public key cryptography. These files are used for cookie encryption, digital signature and challenge/response identification algorithms compatible with the Internet standard security infrastructure.</p>
 		<p>By default, files are not encrypted by <tt>ntp-keygen</tt>. The <tt>-p <i>password</i></tt> option specifies the write password and <tt>-q <i>password</i></tt> option the read password for previously encrypted files. The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program prompts for the password if it reads an encrypted file and the password is missing or incorrect. If an encrypted file is read successfully and no write password is specified, the read password is used as the write password by default.</p>
 		<p>The <tt>ntpd</tt> configuration command <tt>crypto pw <i>password</i></tt> specifies the read password for previously encrypted files. The daemon expires on the spot if the password is missing or incorrect. For convenience, if a file has been previously encrypted, the default read password is the name of the host running the program. If the previous write password is specified as the host name, these files can be read by that host with no explicit password.</p>
 		<p>All files are in PEM-encoded printable ASCII format, so they can be embedded as MIME attachments in mail to other sites and certificate authorities. File names begin with the prefix <tt>ntpkey_</tt> and end with the postfix <tt><i>_hostname.filestamp</i></tt>, where <tt><i>hostname</i></tt> is usually the string returned by the Unix <tt>gethostname()</tt> routine, and <tt><i>filestamp</i></tt> is the NTP seconds when the file was generated, in decimal digits. This both guarantees uniqueness and simplifies maintenance procedures, since all files can be quickly removed by a <tt>rm ntpkey*</tt> command or all files generated at a specific time can be removed by a <tt>rm *<i>filestamp</i></tt> command. To further reduce the risk of misconfiguration, the first two lines of a file contain the file name and generation date and time as comments.</p>
-		<p>All files are installed by default in the keys directory <tt>/usr/local/etc</tt>, which is normally in a shared filesystem in NFS-mounted networks. The actual location of the keys directory and each file can be overridden by configuration commands, but this is not recommended. Normally, the files for each host are generated by that host and used only by that host, although exceptions exist as noted later on this page.</p>
+		<p>All files are installed by default in the keys directory <tt>/etc/ntp/crypto</tt>. The actual location of the keys directory and each file can be overridden by configuration commands, but this is not recommended. Normally, the files for each host are generated by that host and used only by that host, although exceptions exist as noted later on this page.</p>
 		<p>Normally, files containing private values, including the host key, sign key and identification parameters, are permitted root read/write-only; while others containing public values are permitted world readable. Alternatively, files containing private values can be encrypted and these files permitted world readable, which simplifies maintenance in shared file systems. Since uniqueness is insured by the hostname and file name extensions, the files for a NFS server and dependent clients can all be installed in the same shared directory.</p>
 		<p>The recommended practice is to keep the file name extensions when installing a file and to install a soft link from the generic names specified elsewhere on this page to the generated files. This allows new file generations to be activated simply by changing the link. If a link is present, <tt>ntpd</tt> follows it to the file name to extract the filestamp. If a link is not present, <tt>ntpd</tt> extracts the filestamp from the file itself. This allows clients to verify that the file and generation times are always current. The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program uses the same extension for all files generated at one time, so each generation is distinct and can be readily recognized in monitoring data.</p>
 		<h4 id="run">Running the program</h4>
-		<p>The safest way to run the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program is logged in directly as root. The recommended procedure is change to the keys directory, usually <tt>/ust/local/etc</tt>, then run the program. When run for the first time, or if all <tt>ntpkey</tt> files have been removed, the program generates a RSA host key file and matching RSA-MD5 certificate file, which is all that is necessary in many cases. The program also generates soft links from the generic names to the respective files. If run again, the program uses the same host key file, but generates a new certificate file and link.</p>

The program also generates soft links from the generic names to the respective files. If run again, the program uses the same host key file, but generates a new certificate file and link.</p>
 		<p>The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be RSA type. By default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt signatures. When necessary, a different sign key can be specified and this can be either RSA or DSA type. By default, the message digest type is MD5, but any combination of sign key type and message digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can be specified, including those using the MD2, MD5, SHA, SHA1, MDC2 and RIPE160 message digest algorithms. However, the scheme specified in the certificate must be compatible with the sign key. Certificates using any digest algorithm are compatible with RSA sign keys; however, only SHA and SHA1 certificates are compatible with DSA sign keys.</p>
 		<p>Private/public key files and certificates are compatible with other OpenSSL applications and very likely other libraries as well. Certificates or certificate requests derived from them should be compatible with extant industry practice, although some users might find the interpretation of X509v3 extension fields somewhat liberal. However, the identification parameter files, although encoded as the other files, are probably not compatible with anything other than Autokey.</p>
 		<p>Running the program as other than root and using the Unix <tt>su</tt> command to assume root may not work properly, since by default the OpenSSL library looks for the random seed file <tt>.rnd</tt> in the user home directory. However, there should be only one <tt>.rnd</tt>, most conveniently in the root directory, so it is convenient to define the <tt>$RANDFILE</tt> environment variable used by the OpenSSL library as the path to <tt>/.rnd</tt>.</p>

 		<h4 id="descr">Description</h4>
 		<p>The <tt>ntpd</tt> program is an operating system daemon which sets and maintains the system time of day in synchronism with Internet standard time servers. It is a complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but also retains compatibility with version 3, as defined by RFC-1305, and version 1 and 2, as defined by RFC-1059 and RFC-1119, respectively. <tt>ntpd</tt> does most computations in 64-bit floating point arithmetic and does relatively clumsy 64-bit fixed point operations only when necessary to preserve the ultimate precision, about 232 picoseconds. While the ultimate precision is not achievable with ordinary workstations and networks of today, it may be required with future gigahertz CPU clocks and gigabit LANs.</p>
 		<h4 id="op">How NTP Operates</h4>
@@ -49,7 +49,7 @@
 		<h4 id="modes">Operating Modes</h4>
 		<p><tt>ntpd</tt> can operate in any of several modes, including symmetric active/passive, client/server broadcast/multicast and manycast, as described in the <a href="assoc.html">Association Management</a> page. It normally operates continuously while monitoring for small changes in frequency and trimming the clock for the ultimate precision. However, it can operate in a one-time mode where the time is set from an external server and frequency is set from a previously recorded frequency file. A broadcast/multicast or manycast client can discover remote servers, compute server-client propagation delay correction factors and configure itself automatically. This makes it possible to deploy a fleet of workstations without specifying configuration details specific to the local environment.</p>
 		<p>By default, <tt>ntpd</tt> runs in continuous mode where each of possibly several external servers is polled at intervals determined by an intricate state machine. The state machine measures the incidental roundtrip delay jitter and oscillator frequency wander and determines the best poll interval using a heuristic algorithm. Ordinarily, and in most operating environments, the state machine will start with 64s intervals and eventually increase in steps to 1024s. A small amount of random variation is introduced in order to avoid bunching at the servers. In addition, should a server become unreachable for some time, the poll interval is increased in steps to 1024s in order to reduce network overhead.</p>
-		<p>In some cases it may not be practical for <tt>ntpd</tt> to run continuously. A common workaround has been to run the <tt>ntpdate</tt> program from a <tt>cron</tt> job at designated times. However, this program does not have the crafted signal processing, error checking and mitigation algorithms of <tt>ntpd</tt>. The <tt>-q</tt> option is intended for this purpose. Setting this option will cause <tt>ntpd</tt> to exit just after setting the clock for the first time. The procedure for initially setting the clock is the same as in continuous mode; most applications will probably want to specify the <tt>iburst</tt> keyword with the <tt>server</tt> configuration command. With this keyword a volley of messages are exchanged to groom the data and the clock is set in about 10 s. If nothing is heard after a couple of minutes, the daemon times out and exits. After a suitable period of mourning, the <tt>ntpdate</tt> program may be retired.</p>

 		<p>When kernel support is available to discipline the clock frequency, which is the case for stock Solaris, Tru64, Linux and FreeBSD, a useful feature is available to discipline the clock frequency. First, <tt>ntpd</tt> is run in continuous mode with selected servers in order to measure and record the intrinsic clock frequency offset in the frequency file. It may take some hours for the frequency and offset to settle down. Then the <tt>ntpd</tt> is stopped and run in one-time mode as required. At each startup, the frequency is read from the file and initializes the kernel frequency.</p>
 		<h4 id="poll">Poll Interval Control</h4>
 		<p>This version of NTP includes an intricate state machine to reduce the network load while maintaining a quality of synchronization consistent with the observed jitter and wander. There are a number of ways to tailor the operation in order enhance accuracy by reducing the interval or to reduce network overhead by increasing it. However, the user is advised to carefully consider the consequences of changing the poll adjustment range from the default minimum of 64 s to the default maximum of 1,024 s. The default minimum can be changed with the <tt>tinker minpoll</tt> command to a value not less than 16 s. This value is used for all configured associations, unless overridden by the <tt>minpoll</tt> option on the configuration command. Note that most device drivers will not operate properly if the poll interval is less than 64 s and that the broadcast server and manycast client associations will also use the default, unless overridden.</p>

 		<h4>Description</h4>
-		<tt>ntpdate</tt> sets the local date and time by polling the Network Time Protocol (NTP) server(s) given as the <i>server</i> arguments to determine the correct time. It must be run as root on the local host. A number of samples are obtained from each of the servers specified and a subset of the NTP clock filter and selection algorithms are applied to select the best of these. Note that the accuracy and reliability of <tt>ntpdate</tt> depends on the number of servers, the number of polls each time it is run and the interval between runs.
+		<p><tt>ntpdate</tt> sets the local date and time by polling the Network Time Protocol (NTP) server(s) given as the <i>server</i> arguments to determine the correct time. It must be run as root on the local host. A number of samples are obtained from each of the servers specified and a subset of the NTP clock filter and selection algorithms are applied to select the best of these. Note that the accuracy and reliability of <tt>ntpdate</tt> depends on the number of servers, the number of polls each time it is run and the interval between runs.</p>
 		<p><tt>ntpdate</tt> can be run manually as necessary to set the host clock, or it can be run from the host startup script to set the clock at boot time. This is useful in some cases to set the clock initially before starting the NTP daemon <tt>ntpd</tt>. It is also possible to run <tt>ntpdate</tt> from a <tt>cron</tt> script. However, it is important to note that <tt>ntpdate</tt> with contrived <tt>cron</tt> scripts is no substitute for the NTP daemon, which uses sophisticated algorithms to maximize accuracy and reliability while minimizing resource use. Finally, since <tt>ntpdate</tt> does not discipline the host clock frequency as does <tt>ntpd</tt>, the accuracy using <tt>ntpdate</tt> is limited.</p>
 		<p>Time adjustments are made by <tt>ntpdate</tt> in one of two ways. If <tt>ntpdate</tt> determines the clock is in error more than 0.5 second it will simply step the time by calling the system <tt>settimeofday()</tt> routine. If the error is less than 0.5 seconds, it will slew the time by calling the system <tt>adjtime()</tt> routine. The latter technique is less disruptive and more accurate when the error is small, and works quite well when <tt>ntpdate</tt> is run by <tt>cron</tt> every hour or two.</p>
 		<p><tt>ntpdate</tt> will decline to set the date if an NTP server daemon (e.g., <tt>ntpd</tt>) is running on the same host. When running <tt>ntpdate</tt> on a regular basis from <tt>cron</tt> as an alternative to running a daemon, doing so once every hour or two will result in precise enough timekeeping to avoid stepping the clock.</p>

 		<p>The <tt>ntpq</tt> utility program is used to monitor NTP daemon <tt>ntpd</tt> operations and determine performance. It uses the standard NTP mode 6 control message formats defined in Appendix B of the NTPv3 specification RFC1305. The same formats are used in NTPv4, although some of the variables have changed and new ones added. The description on this page is for the NTPv4 variables.</p>
 		<p>The program can be run either in interactive mode or controlled using command line arguments.

These terms are precisely defined in RFC-1305.</p>
 		<h4>Options</h4>
 		<dl>
-			<dt><tt>-d</tt>
-			<dd>Turns on some debugging output.
 			<dt><tt>-n</tt>
 			<dd>Turns off the printing of host names; instead, host IP addresses are given. This may be useful if a nameserver is down.
-			<dt><tt>-r <i>retries</i></tt>
-			<dd>Sets the number of retransmission attempts for each host (default = 5).
-			<dt><tt>-t <i>timeout</i></tt>
-			<dd>Sets the retransmission timeout (in seconds) (default = 2).
-			<dt><tt>-v</tt>
-			<dd>Prints verbose information about the NTP servers.

 		<h4>Description</h4>
 		<p>The <tt>tickadj</tt> program reads, and optionally modifies, several timekeeping-related variables in older kernels that do not have support for precision ttimekeeping, including HP-UX, SunOS, Ultrix, SGI and probably others. Those machines provide means to patch the kernel <tt>/dev/kmem</tt>. Newer machines with precision time support, including Solaris, Tru64, FreeBSD and Linux (with PPSkit patch) should NOT use the program. The particular variables that can be changed with <tt>tickadj</tt> include <tt>tick</tt>, which is the number of microseconds added to the system time for a clock interrupt, <tt>tickadj</tt>, which sets the slew rate and resolution used by the <tt>adjtime</tt> system call, and <tt>dosynctodr</tt>, which indicates to the kernels on some machines whether they should internally adjust the system clock to keep it in line with time-of-day clock or not.</p>
+		<p>On Linux, only the <tt>tick</tt> variable is supported and the only allowed argument is the tick value.</p>
 		<p>By default, with no arguments, <tt>tickadj</tt> reads the variables of interest in the kernel and displays them. At the same time, it determines an &quot;optimal&quot; value for the value of the <tt>tickadj</tt> variable if the intent is to run the <tt>ntpd</tt> Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon, and prints this as well. Since the operation of <tt>tickadj</tt> when reading the kernel mimics the operation of similar parts of the <tt>ntpd</tt> program fairly closely, this can be useful when debugging problems with <tt>ntpd</tt>.</p>
 		<p>Note that <tt>tickadj</tt> should be run with some caution when being used for the first time on different types of machines. The operations which <tt>tickadj</tt> tries to perform are not guaranteed to work on all Unix machines and may in rare cases cause the kernel to crash.</p>
